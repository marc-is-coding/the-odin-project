/* should have just put padding: 8px in header; apart from that my solution looks good */

/* took me very long to find out, that there was a default margin on <ul> elements
*
* finally found solution with undoing all the changes i made and looking at the default state of the picture; maybe the difference between a class-selector (i.e. .logo) and a type-selector (i.e. ul)
*
* google: css on ul elements there is an margin on the left side */
